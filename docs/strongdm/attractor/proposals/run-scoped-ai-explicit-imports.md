# Proposal: Run-Scoped `.ai` Workspace with Branch-Safe Materialization

## Problem

The March 2, 2026 incident (`run_id=01KJPDK649C65Y07TBX1041C73`) exposed two
separate failures:

1. stale binary behavior (`cee6fe8e...`) truncated same-path copies to zero
   bytes
2. startup materialization implicitly copied gitignored repo-local `.ai/*.md`,
   which pulled stale Solitaire content into the run

The stale-binary bug is resolved separately. This proposal fixes the input
boundary and durability model so the same class of incident does not recur.

## Evidence Anchors

1. incident run id: `01KJPDK649C65Y07TBX1041C73`
2. run base SHA vs local binary SHA mismatch was confirmed
3. Solitaire source was `/home/user/code/kilroy/.ai/spec.md` and hash-matched
   the startup snapshot copy
4. parallel worktree recreation amplified bad state because untracked `.ai`
   content is not present in fresh worktrees

## Scope

This proposal changes workspace-state handling for materialized inputs and
run-scoped scratch files. It does not move canonical run/stage logs away from
`logs_root`.

## Normative Constraints This Proposal Keeps

When `inputs.materialize.enabled=true`, the current Appendix C.1 contracts stay
intact:

1. run startup snapshot under `logs_root/input_snapshot/`
2. run-level manifest at `logs_root/inputs_manifest.json`
3. branch-level manifests at `<branch_logs_root>/inputs_manifest.json`
4. stage-level manifests at `logs_root/<node_id>/inputs_manifest.json`
5. `KILROY_INPUTS_MANIFEST_PATH` exposed to stage runtimes
6. `include` fail-on-unmatched with
   `failure_reason=input_include_missing`
7. `default_include` best-effort
8. transitive closure when `follow_references=true`
9. additive `infer_with_llm` fallback to scanner-only closure on inferer failure

When `inputs.materialize.enabled=false`, materialization manifests/env injection
remain suppressed, matching current tests and runtime behavior.

## Decision

Adopt this boundary:

1. stage-visible run scratch files live under
   `./.ai/runs/<run_id>/...` in each active worktree
2. shared source-of-truth inputs stay outside `.ai` (for example `docs/`,
   `specs/`, `policies/`)
3. implicit repo-root `.ai/*` ingestion is disabled by default
4. branch/resume hydration uses persisted snapshot state, not mutable developer
   workspace state

## Branch-Safe Snapshot Lineage

The previous draft used a single "latest revision" model. That is not safe for
parallel branches. This proposal uses explicit lineage.

### Run Startup

1. create run snapshot revision `R0` at startup under
   `logs_root/input_snapshot/`
2. set run head pointer to `R0`

### Fan-Out Branch Fork

1. for each branch `B`, create branch lineage rooted at current run head
2. persist branch lineage metadata in `<branch_logs_root>/inputs_manifest.json`
   with `base_run_revision=<Rn>` and `branch_head_revision=<B0>`
3. branch hydration reads from branch head only

### Branch Execution

1. branch nodes can advance only branch-local revisions (`B0 -> B1 -> ...`)
2. branch updates do not mutate run head directly
3. stage manifests record `(run_base_revision, branch_revision)` for each stage

### Fan-In Merge Back to Run Lineage

1. merge happens once, at fan-in boundary
2. default merge policy for `./.ai/runs/<run_id>/...` is `none`
   (no implicit cross-branch promotion)
3. optional explicit promotion list can be configured at fan-in
4. conflicting writes in promoted paths produce deterministic
   `failure_reason=input_snapshot_conflict` with conflict list
5. successful merge creates new run head `Rn+1`

### Resume

Resume restores from persisted run head and branch lineage metadata, never from
mutable source workspace files.

## Explicit Import Declaration Schema

Current runtime config has `include` and `default_include`. This proposal adds a
typed alias while preserving backward compatibility.

### New Schema

`inputs.materialize.imports`:

```yaml
inputs:
  materialize:
    imports:
      - pattern: "docs/requirements.md"
        required: true
      - pattern: "docs/context/*.md"
        required: false
```

### Mapping Rules

1. `required=true` maps to `include`
2. `required=false` maps to `default_include`
3. `required` defaults to `true`
4. normalized output preserves first-seen order and de-duplicates exact entries

### Validation Rules

1. `pattern` is required and must be non-empty
2. `imports` cannot be used together with explicit `include`/`default_include`
   in the same config (deterministic validation error:
   `failure_reason=input_imports_conflict`)
3. unknown fields in import entries fail validation
4. existing configs that use only `include/default_include` continue to work
   unchanged

## Migration for Existing Hardcoded `.ai` Runtime Paths

The proposal now includes concrete migration for known root `.ai` assumptions.

1. `internal/attractor/engine/stage_status_contract.go`
   - keep primary `worktree/status.json`
   - change fallback order:
     1. `worktree/.ai/runs/<run_id>/status.json`
     2. legacy `worktree/.ai/status.json` (compatibility window)
2. `internal/attractor/runstate/snapshot.go`
   - read postmortem/review first from
     `worktree/.ai/runs/<run_id>/postmortem_latest.md` and
     `worktree/.ai/runs/<run_id>/review_final.md`
   - then legacy fallback to root `.ai/...` paths
3. `cmd/kilroy/attractor_status_follow.go`
   - update displayed source labels to new run-scoped paths
   - keep legacy-path display fallback during migration

## Compatibility Window

1. one release supports dual-read (run-scoped first, legacy fallback second)
2. emit deprecation warnings when legacy root `.ai` paths are consumed
3. remove legacy fallback in the next major cleanup after migration telemetry
   confirms low usage

## Implementation Plan

1. config + validation
   - add `imports` schema to `InputMaterializationConfig`
   - implement normalize/validate mapping and conflict rules
2. lineage-aware snapshot manager
   - add run/branch revision lineage metadata and deterministic merge
   - emit deterministic conflict failures
3. hydration integration
   - hydrate run/branch/resume from lineage pointers
4. runtime path migration
   - patch the three cited files to run-scoped-first dual-read
5. docs and examples
   - update templates to write scratch/output under `./.ai/runs/<run_id>/...`
   - keep examples explicit about `inputs.materialize.enabled` semantics

## Test Plan

1. branch isolation:
   - branch A writes run-scoped file, branch B cannot observe it before fan-in
2. deterministic fan-in merge:
   - explicit promotion conflict yields `input_snapshot_conflict`
3. lineage resume:
   - recreated worktree restores from persisted run/branch lineage state
4. conditional contracts:
   - manifests/env present only when `inputs.materialize.enabled=true`
   - manifests/env suppressed when disabled
5. imports schema:
   - mapping to `include/default_include` is correct
   - `imports + include/default_include` emits `input_imports_conflict`
6. path migration:
   - status fallback and status-follow prefer run-scoped `.ai/runs/<run_id>`
   - legacy root `.ai` fallback still works during compatibility window
7. unchanged C.1 behavior:
   - `input_include_missing`, default-include best effort, closure, and inferer
     fallback behavior remain intact

## Reviewer Checklist

1. Does the proposal avoid cross-branch leakage by defining branch lineage and
   fan-in merge rules?
2. Does it include concrete migration for the three cited hardcoded `.ai` path
   locations?
3. Does it scope manifest/env contracts to
   `inputs.materialize.enabled=true`?
4. Does it define a concrete `imports` schema and validator behavior?
5. Does it preserve canonical `logs_root` artifacts and Appendix C.1 semantics?

## Incident-Specific Cleanup

Removed stale local scratch file:
`/home/user/code/kilroy/.ai/spec.md`
