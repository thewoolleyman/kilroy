# Kilroy Attractor: Spec Requirement to Test Coverage Map

This document maps spec requirements (line-numbered) to concrete Go tests in this repo. Tests are written to the spec contract (artifacts, observable behavior, and external interfaces) rather than internal implementation details where feasible.

Legend:
- `Covered (unit)`: behavior validated via unit tests.
- `Covered (integration)`: behavior validated via end-to-end-ish tests (git repo + logs layout + fake CXDB / fake provider servers).
- `Partial`: implemented but not strongly/fully asserted by tests, or test coverage is indirect.
- `Missing`: no meaningful test (and often no implementation).

Line numbers are from the current in-repo markdown specs; they will drift if the docs change.
